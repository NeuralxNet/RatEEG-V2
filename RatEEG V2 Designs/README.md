<Design Credits>
This project started with [RatEEG] - https://github.com/tharaka27/RatEEG design. But we later moved to OpenBCI 8bit design for more accuracy. So credit of initial design goes to OpenBCI - https://github.com/OpenBCI. We have changed the hardware, firmware to match our needs.
  
We have added the gerber files and BOM for anyone who is willing to build from the scratch
  
<h2>Work flow</h2>

 - [x] schematic designing the EEG module
