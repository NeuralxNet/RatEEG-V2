<h2>Design Credits</h2>
This project started with [RatEEG] - https://github.com/tharaka27/RatEEG design. But we later moved to OpenBCI 8bit design for more accuracy. So credit of initial design goes to OpenBCI - https://github.com/OpenBCI. We have changed the hardware, firmware to match our needs.
  
We have added the gerber files and BOM for anyone who is willing to build from the scratch
  
<h2>How</h2>
1. print the PCB<br>
2. Order materials using BOM files. (I found all the necessary components in Mouser)

<h2>Work flow</h2>

 - [x] schematic designing the EEG module
 - [x] PCB print
 - [ ] Writing firmware
 - [ ] Desktop application for debugging
 - [ ] Android/ios app
